# Greed
The first project of the course "Utveckling av mobila applikationer".

The app simulates a game of Greed, played by one person.

## Rules

You need to get >= 200 points on the first throw of a round, otherwise a new round is started.
If you do not get any points on the following throws, you loose all accumulated points for this round and a new round is started.
You get points for the following:

100 times the dice number for three of a kind. 1000 if the number is one.
1000 points for a ladder, 1 to 6.
100 points for 1 and 50 for 5, if they are not part of a ladder or three of a kind.

You may save the points at any point and start a new round, to ensure you do not loose it all.
Each die may only be use for points once and is then saved. If all the dice have been used for points you may throw all six again.
